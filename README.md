### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m **[Asad Hussain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asad-hussain-765502319/)**, a developer based in India.
I love building clean, functional apps from frontend UI to backend logic.
If I get an idea, I usually build it, break it, fix it, and ship it.

My main tech stack is **React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion and GSAP**.  
My favorite tools are **VS Code, Git, GitHub, and Vercel**.

Some of my recent projects includes my personal **[Portfolio](https://asadtechdev.vercel.app/)**, a **[Currency Converter](https://asad-bot07.github.io/Currency-Converter/)**, a **[Password Generator](https://asad-bot07.github.io/Password-Generator/)**, and UI animation experiments with **Motion and GSAP**.

You can reach me **[here](mailto:techie.asad.dev@gmail.com)** anytime.

- **Hobbies:** Coding and Gaming
